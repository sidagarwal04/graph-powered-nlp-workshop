# Graph Powered NLP Workshop

Are you ready to dive into the world of graph databases, harness the power of natural language processing (NLP), and build intelligent applications that understand and respond to human queries? Follow the step-by-step guide to embark on a thrilling journey that combines the strength of [Google PaLM 2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2/) (within [Google MakerSuite](https://developers.generativeai.google/products/makersuite)), [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), and Python and build an intelligent Gen-AI powered Q&A Chatbot.

## Google MakerSuite
Google MakerSuite is a tool designed to facilitate the building of generative AI applications. It provides an efficient user interface (UI) for interacting with some of Google's latest AI models, allowing for the easy translation of prompts into production-ready code that can be integrated into applications​​ ([Source](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/09/make-with-makersuite-part1-introduction.html#:~:text=What%20is%20MakerSuite%3F%20MakerSuite%20is,can%20integrate%20into%20your%20applications)). MakerSuite is browser-based and functions as an integrated development environment (IDE) specifically for prototyping with generative language models. It supports rapid experimentation with different prompts and models, and once a developer is satisfied with their creation, the tool enables easy exportation of the project to Python code. This code can then interact with the same models via the PaLM API​​ ([Source](https://developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/makersuite_quickstart#:~:text=MakerSuite%20is%20a%20browser,Which%20prompt)).

The aim of MakerSuite is to democratize the creation of AI-powered applications, making it accessible to any individual with a Google account. It simplifies the process of building with the PaLM API, which is a platform for machine learning and natural language processing tasks. By utilizing MakerSuite, developers can rapidly prototype and test configurations used in conjunction with the PaLM API, thereby streamlining the development of products and services that leverage Google's generative AI capabilities​​ ([Source](https://www.packtpub.com/article-hub/getting-started-with-google-makersuite#:~:text=Getting%20Started%20with%20Google%20MakerSuite,interacting%20with%20the%20PaLM%20API)).

Furthermore, Google has expanded the reach of MakerSuite to cover 179 countries and territories, making it available to anyone who has a Google Workspace account. This expansion is part of Google's initiative to help users from various backgrounds become AI makers and create innovative applications using their generative models​​ ([Source](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/08/makersuite-expands-adds-new-features-for-ai-makers.html#:~:text=With%20MakerSuite%20we%20want%20to,with%20a%20Google%20Workspace%20account)).

## Neo4j AuraDB
Neo4j AuraDB is a cloud-based graph database service offered by Neo4j. It's designed to provide users with a fully managed graph database as a service (DBaaS), enabling rapid and efficient queries that facilitate real-time analytics and insights ([Source](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/faq/#:~:text=General%20What%20is%20Neo4j%20AuraDB%3F,time%20analytics%20and%20insights))​​. The service is built to be highly available and self-healing, ensuring that it can scale on demand without any loss of service. It includes enterprise-class security features, such as role-based access control in the enterprise tier ([Source](https://aura.support.neo4j.com/hc/en-us/articles/17081071326739-Neo4j-AuraDB-and-Neo4j-AuraDS-products#:~:text=AuraDB%2C%20is%20the%20Neo4j%20graph,with%20the%20enterprise%20tier%20level))​​.
